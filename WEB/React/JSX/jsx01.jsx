/* 
  JSX allows us to write in a syntax almost identical to plain HTML.
  As a result, JSX is a powerful tool to structure our applications.
  JSX uses all valid HTML tags (i.e. div/span, h1-h6, form/input, img, etc).

<div>Hello React!</div>

/* 
  Note: this JSX would not be visible because it needs to be rendered by our application using ReactDOM.render()
